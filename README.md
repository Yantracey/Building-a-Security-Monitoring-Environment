# Building-a-Security-Monitoring-Environment

In this assignment, I played the role of an SOC analyst at Virtual Space Industries (VSI), a company specializing in virtual-reality programs. The task involved monitoring potential cyberattacks, particularly from the competitor JobeCorp, using Splunk to analyze logs from critical systems: an Apache web server hosting the administrative webpage and a Windows operating system running essential back-end operations. The networking team provided past logs to establish baselines. 

After being notified of recent cyberattacks on VSI's systems, I successfully set up monitoring solutions to identify the attacked Windows and Apache servers. Management supplied additional attack logs covering the incident, and I analyzed them using my monitoring solution. This comprehensive approach aimed to assess the efficacy of the monitoring system and formulate strategic responses to potential threats from JobeCorp.
